# presentationTimer

This is a presentation timer, used for events and conferences. 

When configured on a RasPi or similar to load the timer page onto a foldback monitor, a QR code will show up. 
This allows either the technician, or whomever is trying to keep people on time, to load the control page.

Any bug please report to vesnathan@gmail.com.
