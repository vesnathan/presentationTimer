# presentationTimer

This is a presentation timer, used for events and conferences. 

When configured on a RasPi or similar to load http://54.66.111.53:3000/timer/timer.html onto a foldback monitor, a QR code will show up. 
This allows either the technician, or whomever is trying to keep people on time, to load the control page.

Currently running at http://54.66.111.53:3000/timer/demo.html

Main starting page: http://54.66.111.53:3000/timer/
